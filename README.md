# CityMatrix

CityMatrix is an urban decision support system augmented with artificial intelligence, which is 'Ryan' Yan Zhang's Master thesis project at MIT Media Lab City Science group. 

This repo is the UI for the AI assistant of the project, created using Unity.

## Abstract
The decision-making process in urban design and urban planning is outdated. Currently, urban decision-making is mostly a top-down process, with community participation only in its late stages. Furthermore, many design decisions are subjective, rather than based on quantifiable performance and data. Current tools for urban planning do not allow both expert and non-expert stakeholders to explore a range of complex scenarios rapidly with real-time feedback. 

CityMatrix was an effort towards evidence-based, democratic decision-making. Its contributions lie in the application of Machine Learning as a versatile, quick, accurate, and low-cost approach to enable real-time feedback of complex urban simulations and the implementation of the optimization searching algorithms to provide open-ended decision-making suggestions. The goals of CityMatrix were:
